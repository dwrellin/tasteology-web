        <h2>What does cooking mean?</h2>
        <hr />
        <p>
          Is it simply applying heat to a food product? A way of making certain
          food safe to eat? Or a way to create flavour and make food more
          appealing? This is just part of what Herv√© This, the father of
          molecular gastronomy, has dedicated his life to finding out. We spoke
          to him to find out what his experiments have told him. And in the
          process even discovered the secret to cooking the perfect egg...
        </p>

        <h3>The Perfect Egg</h3>
        <p>Keep water between 67 and 68C for a flavourful, tender yolk</p>

          <p>Red</p>
          <p>
            Red foods remind us of berries and soft fruits, so we anticipate a
            sweet taste.

          <p>Green</p>
          <p>
            Fresh, zingy green colours are reminiscent of unripe fruit,
            promising sour or acid flavours
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="cards-block-item">
          <img src="./images/white-spoon.jpg" alt="white in spoon" />
          <p>White</p>
          <p>
            White foods evoke memories of salt and salty flavours, driving the
            expectation of a savoury treat.
